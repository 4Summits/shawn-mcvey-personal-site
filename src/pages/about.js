      Welcome to the new home of my blog and bio page. Let me first say – I like you; we have something in common. I’d like to learn more about you and bring in my resource pool to leverage your business position. If you’ve landed by search or introduction - hello and welcome. The world is in an incredible period of growth. We have 4 billion active users on the internet with the other half of the world, (4 billion coming). I and my network help startups, corporations and independents deploy capital for business growth. We also bring in people to for strategic development. The future of content: I’ve tried a lot of places to build content (LinkedIn, ect) I’ll likely still develop articles and publish items where the digital wind takes me. I am moving into audio and video to quickly distribute information on technology, investing, international business and advising. Good news, my personal stuff will mostly live here.
      </p>
      <p>I’ll be creating some business pieces, but mostly those will be given to partners who want them. If you are someone that wants to explore my network, what I am doing and move into fundraising, scaling, business growth and development, I’m happy to research your work with my team. I am behind your position. It’s a great time to collaborate and build a better world. Let’s make this beautiful planet better than where we found it. I’ve been around the world and to regions where communication is not free, ideas are limited and by some means sanctioned. We live in an incredible time to be able to create, develop and share. That’s what makes our time and location special. I believe in the power of story and the ability to transform. In my time I have been to Asia, Central America, Europe, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands. Each sector, each culture, the people we meet have the ability to add a greater context to the world around us. More so with the power of story through culture. As the world flattens, and boundaries become unhinged by new sectors of the world in social platforms, gaming, AR, YouTube, steaming we have not even seen. Every day the story lines changes.

        It’s a fascinating time. As much as in travel, the learning experience is awkward and I prefer that. That’s what let’s me know I’m working on something new finding new breakthroughs and working on something real. When I share my stories, which seem for me ordinary, people ask me to share them or write them down. I’m working with my team now to develop the narrative in digital format because, we live, sustain and grow through the power of narrative. In music, theater, the arts, we have another side of the mind that develops with creativity and curiosity. That’s why your story is so interesting. We all have a unique timeline to mastery and I’m fascinated by building your personal narrative.

        In my timeline, nothing has come through as a breakpoint without learning a new sector, a new point of view. In this era (and I assume far into the future), we continue to grow by leaning into axis points, into cross sectors of new business intermingling with old. I have firm positions (loosely held) as the world is constantly moving. Working in strategy, investing, and deep mental models from an investing framework, I’ll offer outside positions to review competitive advantage. On the other side. I will never be offended when you tell me I’m wrong. Either with an idea, how I position to a concept. In this context we’re fueled in open forum, please, tell me. We grow as people together when we find ways of being comfortable sharing ideas — no matter what they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first prospect is to tell you about all the jobs I’ve had in my life and as with you, those positions have led you to where you are. Those are good stories. I’m sure you have many and I can’t wait to hear them. I look forward to adding to your experience. I’m excited to share in this story and with all beginnings, I’m pumping with a good dose of caffeine, good music and a promissory vision for the future. Don’t let time stop your position. Let’s move and track up the mountain together.
